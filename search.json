The dataset includes hourly air temperature readings, which we aggregated into daily averages to show broader weather trends over time.\nFrom the graph, we can observe the expected seasonal pattern:\nCooler temperatures during the early and late months of the year\nA noticeable warming trend from spring into summer\nPeak temperatures around Julyâ€“August, followed by a decline toward winter\nThis kind of analysis is useful for studying climate variability, seasonal forecasting, or for use in urban planning, agriculture, or energy consumption models that depend on temperature patterns."
